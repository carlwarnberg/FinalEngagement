### Project-3: Final Engagement

# Description

In a similar vein to Project 2, in this third and final project, we were tasked with performing the duties of a Red Team pen tester and a Blue Team SOC analyst, with the added wrinkle of inspecting network traffic using Wireshark. 

### Objectives

- Discover/Exploit vulnerabilities and perform a pen test on a WordPress server using Kali
- Implement Alarms/Thresholds on the server using Kibana
- Analyze the malicious traffic using Wireshark

Please see the [Red Team](https://github.com/carlwarnberg/Project-3/blob/main/RedTeam.md), [Blue Team](https://github.com/carlwarnberg/Project-3/blob/main/BlueTeam.md), and [Network Analysis](https://github.com/carlwarnberg/Project-3/blob/main/NetworkAnalysis.md) pages for a full summary of all three aspects of the project.

In addition, you can view the [Presentation](https://github.com/carlwarnberg/Project-3/blob/main/Final%20Project.pdf) that I presented with classmates whom I collaborated with on the Red Team portion of this project.
